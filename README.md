One project I would like to work on is something that has to do with health or medicine. Those fields aren't something I usually do projects on but creating an application dealing with health like fitness or nutrition would be something cool to work on.

One project in particular I was planning on working on is an application that would get symptoms as a user input and get a potential diagnosis based on different datasets.
